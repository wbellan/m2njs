# m2njs

Mongrel2 has handlers, which take HTTP requests, and turns them into nicely packed and processed [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) messages for your asynchronous handlers. m2njs is a Mongrel2 handler for Node.js. 

This isn't an intro to Mongrel2. Try the [Mongrel2 Manual](http://mongrel2.org/doc/tip/docs/manual/book.wiki) for that.
